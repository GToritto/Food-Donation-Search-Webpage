# Food-Donation-Search-Webpage
This is a student webpage project using flask framework with a search functionality to find restaurants or food banks within a major city. 
The project is called Golden Plate, and it is a simple web platform tool created to support food scarcity by connecting donors to food banks and restaurants in local communities and vice versa. By simplifying the concept of food donation and research, it allows people and businesses to easily find places accepting food contributions. This creates a smoother process for getting food for those in need. With the current growing problems in society, this project we believe meets a real need for accessible local food donation systems. Being inspired by a similar community focused project called “Feeding America’s Meal Connect,” Golden Plate also addresses the risks of computer automatization services. This digital approach is very user friendly, ethical, and beneficial to vulnerable populations.
